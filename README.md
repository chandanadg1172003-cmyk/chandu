How It Works

1. **HTML** defines the structure with a display screen and buttons.  
2. **CSS** adds styling, colors, and layout using grid display.  
3. **JavaScript** connects button clicks to actions:
   - Numbers and operators are added to an expression string.
   - `=` evaluates the expression using `eval()` safely.
   - `C` clears the entire input.
   - `DEL` removes the last entered character.
